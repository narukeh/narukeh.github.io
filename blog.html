<p>Since a few weeks a had the new domain, <strong>hekuran.ga</strong>, the old domains are still up of course, so the RSS will still work.</p>
<p>I got the domain name from <a href="https://www.freenom.com/">Freenom</a>, since they are for free, and even if it weren't i wanted that <strong>.ga</strong>. they have other tld.</p>
<p>I did strugle getting one though, it turned out if they dont &quot;like&quot; your ip, you wont get one. So i had to use a vpn to open an account, and only then i was able to get it.</p>

<p>Im (probabily) very rarely gonna post, but this is just a statement for the normies using social-media.</p>
<p>This is the independent way, the way it was meant to be, to use the www.</p>
