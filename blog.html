<p><a href="filmsbykris.com">Kris</a> has done a video about <code>ANSI</code> colors and effects on the POSIX shell, some time ago. So i did a version of my site (only the index.html) in which you dont neew a web browser. Only write this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -L hekuran.ga/cli
</code></pre>
<p>Using <a href="https://archlinux.org/packages/community/any/python-ansi2html/">ansi2html</a>, i made a html version of it: <a href="https://hekuran.ga/cli.html">https://hekuran.ga/cli.html</a></p>
<p>Now all i need to do is to figure it out how to do it in on single URL, that then will redirect you respectively. For example, the single URL <a href="https://wttr.in/berlin">https://wttr.in/berlin</a> can be requested from a WebBrowser and a tool like <code>curl</code>. But in my case there is the file <code>cli</code> and <code>cli.html</code>.</p>

<h2 id='new-domain'>New domain</h2>
<small>[<a href='#new-domain'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/new-domain.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p>Since a few weeks a had the new domain, <strong>hekuran.ga</strong>, the old domains are still up of course, so the RSS will still work.</p>
<p>I got the domain name from <a href="https://www.freenom.com/">Freenom</a>, since they are for free, and even if it weren't i wanted that <strong>.ga</strong>. they have other tld.</p>
<p>I did strugle getting one though, it turned out if they dont &quot;like&quot; your ip, you wont get one. So i had to use a vpn to open an account, and only then i was able to get it.</p>

<p>Im (probabily) very rarely gonna post, but this is just a statement for the normies using social-media.</p>
<p>This is the independent way, the way it was meant to be, to use the www.</p>
<p>Btw, this blog system was 100% copied from <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/">luke</a>'s blog: <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb">"lb"</a></p>
